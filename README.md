## 📲 | Contribute
Feel free to contribute your own code to the project, even if you're a complete beginner and just want to help.
There aren't any rules to follow, just try to make your code maintenable and clean.

**It is preferable to contribute on features listed in the [Roadmap section](#--roadmap).**

If there's anything to modify, I'll personally take care of that or I'll alert you on the pull request before merging to the main branch.

**Don't know how to contribute?**
The simplest way is to fork the repository on your own account, make your modifications and just send a pull request to this repository. After proper revisioning, if the request is accepted, you can freely remove the forked repository from your account.

## 🚧 | Roadmap
The following are the features I am currently working on. Free feel to contribute your own code to speed up development times.
- In-game UI panel to display player's stats such as inventory, hunger, thirst and more.
- Inventory and crafting system
- Resource collection
- Survival mechanics (hunger, thirst, maybe stamina)
